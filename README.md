# Cézanne

This is a project showing varied shading algorithms with a simple apple.

[GLSL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenGL_Shading_Language) (OpenGL Shading Language) is mainly used for the shading effect, with the help of [Three.js](https://threejs.org).

## Project Name

> *With an apple I will astonish Paris.*

> Paul Cézanne

Paul Cézanne was a famous and influential Post-Impressionist artist, who drew a great number of apples of all kinds.

This project is intended to show my practice on shading algorithms and implementations.

## Credits

The apple model is downloaded from [TF3FD](http://tf3dm.com/3d-model/apple-51047.html), with extra modification.
